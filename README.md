# Advent of Cyber 2021 by TryHackMe

TryHackMe is a beginner friendly, online platform that teaches cyber security concepts. For the past three years they have had the Advent of Cyber. Each year there are 25 days of a variety of different cyber security exercises leading up until Christmas. The cyber security concepts include web exploitation, network exploitation, OSINT, cloud hacking, and defense blue teaming. 

## Featured Content

This repository features some of the exercises that I felt like I learned the most from. It includes concepts such as Local File Inclusion (LFI) and NoSQL from the web exploitation section. The network section includes packet capture analysis with Wireshark, Windows privilege escalation with netcat, and exploiting Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD). The OSINT section included the use of Twitter and GitHub to compile and investigation. The cloud hacking section included the introduction to Amazon S3, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and AWS Elastic Container Registry (ERC). The defense blue teaming includes phishing analysis methods, the basics of YARA, OLE file analysis with Oledump, and PowerShell analysis with Full Event Log View.
